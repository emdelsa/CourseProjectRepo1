### Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

### 1. Introduction
This tidy data set has been prepared for the Course Project assignment. 

This tidy data set was prepared from the raw data provided by www.smartlab.ws. The data is the result of a series of experiments carried out with a group of **30 subjects** within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each subject performed **six activities** (WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, samples of 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the **training data** and 30% the **test data**. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion **components**, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into **body acceleration** and **gravity acceleration**. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain **Jerk signals**. Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals in order to obtain **frequency domain** values. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating estimation variables (mean, std deviation, median, max, min, interquartile, etc.) from the time and frequency domain.

More information on the raw data can be obtained from http://www.smartlab.ws

This data set complies with the following requirements:

1. There is only one observation per row
2. There is only one variable per column
3. The data belongs to a single observation model: The only included observations are those that can be modelled as having non missing values of Activity, Subject, Domain, Component, Measurement, Axis, Variable and Average
4. According to the Course Project requirement, only two statistical estimation variables included: mean and standard deviation
5. According to the Course Project requirement, this data set merges the observations of the training and test sets

According to this model this data set contains 6 x 30 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 = 8640 observations and 8 columns

This data set is provided as a data frame in a file called "result.txt""
